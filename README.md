# Comparison-of-models-with-Keras-and-PyTorch

1. Dataset used here is of Image classification between cracks and no-cracks in Concrete slabs.
2. Comparison of VGG16 and Resnet50 with Keras framework.
3. Resnet18 with PyTorch framework.
4. Comparison of accuracy and make prediction for each model in each framework.
